# Polyglot Data Science {#chapter-10-polyglot-data-science}

<!-- ##### Motivation -->
In a digital product or service, it's good idea to rely on as a little as possible, including programming languages.
When you're building, analising, there's no harm in using other languages.

When you're 


The command line is everywhere.
It's a super glue.
Useful for when you're in another environment.

Let's be honest, you're not going to spend all your time at the command line.
Neither do I.
Depending on the project or task, I'm often in a Jupyter notebook, RStudio, ...

Use the tool that gets the job done
Language wars are boring and unproductive.

## Overview

In this chapter I cover:




## Leveraging the Command Line in Python

In scripts.

### Jupyter Console and Notebook

Jupyter Console with IPython kernel




<!-- #TODO: MUST: Make screenshot of Jupyter Lab, showing both a terminal and ! and %%bash -->

### Python scripts with subprocess

The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This module intends to replace several older modules and functions: os.system

<!-- TODO: MUST: Create python script that uses the subprocess module. -->


### Python scripts with 

## Leveraging the Command Line in R

### RStudio IDE

<!-- #TODO: MUST: Make screenshot of RStudio, showing terminal tab -->

### R Scripts

- pipe
- fread
- processx
- 


## Leveraging the Command Line Elsewhere

### Clipboard

yank
pbcopy pbpaste

when formatting emailadresses


### Apache Spark

<!-- #TODO: Explain Spark in one or two sentences. Actions and Transformation -->

<!-- TODO: SHOULD include reference to spark and https://scala-lang.org/ -->

pipe transformation

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html
pipe(command, [envVars]) 
 	Pipe each partition of the RDD through a shell command, e.g. a Perl or bash script. RDD elements are written to the process's stdin and lines output to its stdout are returned as an RDD of strings. 

- result needs to be converted to integer explicitly
- piping multiple commands is difficult (it's not a shell)
- one item per line

```{console, remove=list("alias", "cache")}
alias spark-shell echo
spark-shell --master local[6]#!enter=FALSE
C-C#!literal=FALSE
cat /data/.cache/spark
```

Also available in PySpark and

It seems, after all, that the external script should be present on all executor nodes. One way to do this is to pass your script via spark-submit (e.g. --files script.sh) and then you should be able to refer that (e.g. "./script.sh") in rdd.pipe.


### Julia

<!-- #TODO: Figure out whether I think this section is necessary -->

Blog post with an introduction: https://blog.leahhanson.us/post/julia/julia-commands.html



### Other IDEs

- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal
- Emacs
- VIM (using ! command)
